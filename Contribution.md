As with all Open Source software, contributions to Exerciser are welcome.

An excellent way to contribute is testing and trying Exerciser to find some issues. If you find one, don't be shy; submit your issue [here](https://github.com/llaske/Exerciser/issues) by giving the maximum information on it and precisely detailed steps to reproduce it. We will check your issue and ask you for more information if needed.

If you're a developer, the best way is to first [setup Exerciser](https://github.com/llaske/ExerciserReact#steps-to-run-project) and then also [setup Sugarizer](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/blob/dev/docs/tutorial/VanillaJS/step0.md). Testing the functionality requires using Sugarizer features like `Sharing the Exercise,` `Using Journals,` and many more need Exerciser to be deployed on Sugarizer.

When you think you're ready, you could try to fix some current issues [here](https://github.com/llaske/Exerciser/issues). If you find a fix, send a Pull Request, and we will be pleased to review it.


So to send your Pull Request:

* [ ] Clone this repository,
* [ ] Fork the **master** branch of your new repository,
* [ ] Update this new branch with your contribution and commit your changes,
* [ ] Send a pull request from your new branch to the dev branch of this repository.

Few rules to respect when you fix an issue:

* [ ] Ensure your pull request contains only updates related to the fix,
* [ ] Respect indentation of the original file,
* [ ] Mention the issue number in the pull request but not in the commit message


Please note there is <u>no need to ask permission to work on an issue</u>. You should check for pull requests linked to an issue you are addressing; if there are none, assume nobody has done anything. Begin to fix the problem, test, make your commits, push your commits, then make a pull request. These practices allow the competition of ideas and give priority to meritocracy.

Thanks in advance for your contribution, and become a member of the Exerciser community!
